i wanted to make a pie chart of how i spend my time by pulling the data from my trusty iCal app... 

i am using the [icalendar](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/icalendar) package 

# to do: 

- get total total time (all of the time for the calendar)
- get "unused time" ( total total - total calendar'd time)
- make it work for a date range (weekly / monthly basis)

# future: 

- automatically export calendars by running the script 
- make a standalone button / app
